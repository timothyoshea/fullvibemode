# Claude Code Best Practices

## Setup and Configuration

### Memory Management
- Use CLAUDE.md files at project and user levels
- Structure memories with bullet points and clear sections
- Update memories regularly to keep context current
- Use @path/to/import for modular memory organization

### Hooks Configuration
- Start with conservative permissions
- Implement safety checks in pre-tool hooks
- Use post-tool hooks for logging and auditing
- Test hooks thoroughly before deployment

### Multi-Agent Workflows
- Configure MCP servers for different domains
- Use appropriate transport types (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- Implement proper authentication for remote servers
- Organize servers by scope (user, project, local)

## Operational Best Practices

### Context Management
- Use # shortcut to quickly add memories
- Leverage /memory command for context updates
- Import relevant files with @ mentions
- Structure project context hierarchically

### Automation Strategy
- Implement incremental automation
- Start with read-only operations
- Add write permissions gradually
- Always maintain audit trails

### Thinking Modes
- Use extended thinking for complex problems
- Apply iterative refinement techniques
- Combine thinking with research tools
- Document thinking outcomes for future reference

## Security and Safety

### Hook Safety
- Validate all command inputs
- Block dangerous operations
- Log all tool usage
- Implement rollback mechanisms

### Permission Management
- Use principle of least privilege
- Regularly review and update permissions
- Implement context-aware permissions
- Monitor tool usage patterns

### Data Protection
- Avoid committing sensitive data
- Use .gitignore for temporary files
- Implement proper secret management
- Regular security audits of configurations

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Tool Usage
- Batch multiple operations when possible
- Use appropriate search tools for different tasks
- Leverage caching mechanisms
- Monitor resource usage

### Context Optimization
- Keep memories focused and relevant
- Remove outdated context regularly
- Use modular memory organization
- Optimize for frequently accessed information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Hook execution failures
- Permission denied errors
- Context loading problems
- Tool timeout issues

### Debugging Strategies
- Check hook logs for errors
- Verify permission settings
- Test individual components
- Use verbose logging for diagnosis

## Advanced Features

### Custom Slash Commands
- Create domain-specific commands
- Implement parameterized prompts
- Use for frequently repeated tasks
- Document custom commands thoroughly

### Integration Patterns
- IDE integration best practices
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- External tool connectivity
- API integration patterns
