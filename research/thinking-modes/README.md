# Claude Code Extended Thinking Modes

## Overview
Claude Code supports extended thinking capabilities for complex reasoning tasks.

## Activation Methods

### Basic Thinking
- Use "think" to trigger initial extended thinking
- Claude displays thinking process as italic gray text
- Allows for step-by-step reasoning visualization

### Intensified Thinking
Progressively deeper analysis with:
- "think more" - Additional reasoning depth
- "think harder" - More intensive analysis
- "think longer" - Extended exploration of ideas

### Ultra Thinking
For maximum reasoning depth:
- "think ultra hard"
- "think deeply about this"
- "think through all possibilities"

## Best Use Cases

### Complex Architecture Planning
- Designing system architectures
- Planning multi-component integrations
- Evaluating architectural trade-offs

### Advanced Debugging
- Analyzing intricate bug patterns
- Understanding complex error chains
- Identifying root causes in complex systems

### Implementation Planning
- Breaking down complex features
- Planning step-by-step implementation
- Considering edge cases and error handling

### Codebase Analysis
- Understanding large codebases
- Identifying patterns and anti-patterns
- Planning refactoring strategies

## Advanced Techniques

### Iterative Refinement
1. Start with basic thinking
2. Ask follow-up questions to deepen analysis
3. Use "think more" to explore additional angles
4. Combine with specific domain questions

### Combining with Tools
- Use thinking modes before complex searches
- Apply extended thinking to tool output analysis
- Use thinking for planning multi-step operations

### Context Building
- Use thinking to understand project requirements
- Apply extended thinking to constraint analysis
- Use for stakeholder requirement analysis

## Examples

### Architecture Planning
```
User: "Design a microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform"
Response: "think ultra hard about this architecture design"
[Extended thinking process displayed]
[Comprehensive architecture plan with trade-offs]
```

### Complex Debugging
```
User: "This authentication system is failing randomly"
Response: "think deeply about potential race conditions and timing issues"
[Detailed analysis of potential causes]
[Systematic debugging approach]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use for Complex Tasks**: Reserve extended thinking for genuinely complex problems
2. **Iterative Approach**: Start with basic thinking, then intensify as needed
3. **Combine with Research**: Use thinking modes when analyzing documentation or code
4. **Context Matters**: Extended thinking works best with sufficient context about the problem
